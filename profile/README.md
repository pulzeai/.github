## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Pulze! 
We are a venture-backed startup based in San Francisco, dedicated to simplifying the way queries are processed and routed. 
We are proud to open source our KNN router, an Intent-tuned LLM router that intelligently selects the best LLM for a user query.

## Open-Source Projects

You can find our router [here](https://github.com/pulzeai-oss/knn-router)

## Useful Resources

You can find our documentation [here](https://github.com/pulzeai-oss/knn-router/tree/main/docs). This includes information on how to install and use the KNN router. We are constantly adding new documentation, so be sure to check back often.
